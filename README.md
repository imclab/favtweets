# FavTweets

This is a sample app written to demonstrate the capabilities of Punch. 

Check how this uses custom content handler to fetch the favorite tweets from the Twitter API. Also, we use a custom helper to set a cookie (to store the selected background image) and render different layouts for homepage and results page. 

Also, this uses [Handlebars](handlebarsjs.com) as the template engine instead of the default Mustache template engine.

Open the `config.json` to see all these customizations.

## How to Run

* Download the code to your machine.
* Then, inside directory run `punch s`
* Now, point your browser to `http://localhost:9009`.
